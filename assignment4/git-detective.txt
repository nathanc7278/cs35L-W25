Doing the following command:

git log -S 'In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree"' 

shows us 2 commits.

git log -S 'In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected."

does not show up on when using git log because the changes in the commit separate this string into multiple lines with '+' appended to the front. Here is the output of git log:

From commit e85701b4af5b7c2a9f3a1b07858703318dce365d

we see that:

+ * In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a
+   merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and
+   led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected.
+   (merge 92481d1b26 js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo later to maint).

git show 92481d1b26

On the top of this commit it says:

"In the previous commit, we fixed a segmentation fault when a tree object could not be written."

So we look in the previous commit with:

git show 92481d1b26^

The commit ID of the change to git merge-tree is: 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc

Johannes Schindelin authored the changes. The changes that were made were for when the tree objects were not written. Every time a merge operation happened, there was an additional return statement to make sure that the tree object was not accessed later when it was null, causing a segfault.

git format-patch -1 92481d1b26^ to create a patch file.
